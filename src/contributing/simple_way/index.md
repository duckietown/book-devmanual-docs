# The simple way to edit the documentation

The simplest way to contribute to the documentation is to click any of the "âœŽ" icons next to the headers, in the book itself.

```{figure} ../../_images/contributing/simple/step1.png
:name: fig:simple_way_1

Click on edit button.
```

They link to the "edit" page in Github. One can make and commit the edits in only a few seconds.

If you are in the Duckietown organization, then you can just "edit" the page then and there.
Otherwise, you need to "fork" the repo. Don't worry, it's a one click process.

```{figure} ../../_images/contributing/simple/s2.png
:name: fig:simple_way_2

You will land on GitHub
```

Do your edits where appropriate.

```{figure} ../../_images/contributing/simple/s3.png
:name: fig:simple_way_3

Editing the docs.
```

You can check the outcome by clicking on `Preview changes`, note that not all functionalities are visible by the preview. For large changes refer to [](#duckumentation-workflow).


```{figure} ../../_images/contributing/simple/s4.png
:name: fig:simple_way_4

A preview of the changes.
```

Then after your edits, in the bottom part of the webpage, describe your commit and click on `Propose file change`. When committing, please choose "create branch".

```{figure} ../../_images/contributing/simple/s5.png
:name: fig:simple_way_5

Describe and commit.
```

Then, click on `Create pull request`, as you probably don't have rights to push directly.

```{figure} ../../_images/contributing/simple/s6.png
:name: fig:simple_way_6

Create a pull request.
```

Again you need to confirm that you want to open the pull request.

```{figure} ../../_images/contributing/simple/s7.png
:name: fig:simple_way_7

Confirm a pull request.
```
