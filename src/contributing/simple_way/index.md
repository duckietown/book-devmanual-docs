# The simple way to edit the documentation

The simplest way to contribute to the documentation is to click any of the "✎" icons next to the headers, in the book itself.

```{figure} ../../_images/contributing/simple/s1.png
:name: fig:simple_way_1

Click on edit button.
```

They link to the "edit" page in Github. One can make and commit the edits in only a few seconds.

If you are in the Duckietown organization, then you can just "edit" the page then and there.
Otherwise, you need to "fork" the repo. Don't worry, it's a one click process.

```{figure} ../../_images/contributing/simple/s2.png
:name: fig:simple_way_2

You will land on GitHub
```

Do your edits where appropriate.

```{figure} ../../_images/contributing/simple/s3.png
:name: fig:simple_way_3

Editing the docs.
```

You can check the outcome by clicking on `Preview changes`, note that not all functionalities are visible by the preview. For large changes refer to [](#duckumentation-workflow).


```{figure} ../../_images/contributing/simple/s4.png
:name: fig:simple_way_4

A preview of the changes.
```

Then after your edits, in the bottom part of the webpage, describe your commit and click on `Propose file change`. When committing, please choose "create branch".

```{figure} ../../_images/contributing/simple/s5.png
:name: fig:simple_way_5

Describe and commit.
```

Then, click on `Create pull request`, as you probably don't have rights to push directly.

```{figure} ../../_images/contributing/simple/s6.png
:name: fig:simple_way_6

Create a pull request.
```

Again you need to confirm that you want to open the pull request.

```{figure} ../../_images/contributing/simple/s7.png
:name: fig:simple_way_7

Confirm a pull request.
```
